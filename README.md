# Differentiation-Integration-Graphical-Demo
A basic demo of differentation and integration on polynomials using graphical representation in a Java Application.

This is a small project I made in a week (dated 25/12/2023 - 30/12/2023), when I had some free time over the Christmas break.
A simple application to graph any polynomial function and it's derivatives (1st,2nd). You can also compute integral areas. 

I used the Swing(Java) library for visuals (the GUI and the graph).

How to run:
  
  •  Download and install the latest version of Java Runtime Environment (Java 8) from:
                  https://www.java.com/en/download/
                  
  •  Download the Differentiation Calculator.jar file from the repository and run it.




Syntax for inputting functions
all functions input should be mathematical polynomials (look on wikipedia what constitutes a 'polynomial')
any term of a function can be written in these ways:
[number]x 
[number]x^[number]
[number] can be an expression, so long as it is bracketed e.g 
"(24.2/52)x^2" is completely valid
the terms are seperated by plus symbols only
[term] + [term] + [term]
[term] + [term] - [term] is invalid
so to write terms with negative co-efficients, place them in a bracketed expression 
e.g (-6)x^2 + (-5)x is equal to -6x^2 - 5x

Here are some valid polynomial inputs
x^2 + 3
x^3 + (-3)x^2 + (-1/3)x + 4
5x^(-2)
