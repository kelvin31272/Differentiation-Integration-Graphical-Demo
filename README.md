# Differentiation-Integration-Graphical-Demo
A basic demo of differentation and integration on polynomials using graphical representation in a Java Application.

This is a small project I made in a week (dated 25/12/2023 - 30/12/2023). I had some free time over the Christmas break.
When I started, I was familiar with the java-based language Processing 4 (https://processing.org/). I wanted to learn the basics of Java by applying it in a small project, and the idea for creating a simple application to graph any function, and compute it's derivatives, seemed very interesting to me, so I decided to go and make it! The idea of adding integration came later. I learned a lot of Java, and I also learned how to use Visual Studio Code as an efficient text editor.

I used the Swing(Java) library for visuals (the GUI and the graph).

How to run:
  •  Download and install the latest version of Java Runtime Environment (Java 8) from:
                  https://www.java.com/en/download/
  •  Download the Differentiation Calculator.jar file from the repository and run it.
